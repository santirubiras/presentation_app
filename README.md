This app lets you take a picture with the camera and add it to the app and also add a photo from gallery (local storage). You can delete photos that you donâ€™t want anymore. Also you can do a presentation with the pictures of the app that changes the picture every 5 seconds and if you click on the picture the presentation stops.   
All functions are implemented in the app.
